# hyperledger-workspace

The three projects are as follows:

# hyperledger-fabric-setup

This project contains a docker-compose file for seting up a dev environment locally for hyperledger fabric.

# biz-network-definition

This is collection of files that can be compiled into a .bna file and uploaded to create smart contracts running on the Hyperledger fabric.

# taxtime-quick-biz-loans-api

This is a node js project that interacts with the hyperledger blockchain. It will connect to the smart contracts (chaincode) running in hyperledger as a specific participant (WebAppAdmin by default).
